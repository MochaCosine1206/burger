# Eat-Da-Burger

Ah, the classic Eat-Da-Burger App.  Moving burgers has never been so easy as to click a button.

*But*  what is happening really?

This app utilizes a full MVC, or Model View Controller, using api routes to update items in a database.  That's all folks.

 - Create - Add a burger!
 - Read - See the burgers!
 - Update - Change the burgers!
 - Delete - Functionality is invisible(nonexistant!)

In order to install, please clone the folder to your computer, run npm -i, create the database, and launch server.js.
